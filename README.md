# Verilog Cache Project

## Overview
This project implements a cache memory system in Verilog. It includes the cache memory module, a cache controller, and a testbench for verification. The design aims to enhance data access speed by storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer.

```

## Features
- Cache memory implementation with configurable parameters.
- Cache controller that manages hits and misses.
- Testbench to verify the functionality of the cache system.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have a Verilog simulator installed.
4. Compile the source files and run the testbench to verify the implementation.

## Running Simulations
To run the simulations, use the following command in your terminal:
```
<simulator_command> testbench/cache_tb.v
```
Replace `<simulator_command>` with the command specific to your Verilog simulator.

## Design Considerations
- The cache size and block size can be configured in `defines.vh`.
- Ensure that the testbench covers all possible scenarios for thorough verification.
