# Verilog Cache Project

## Overview
This project implements a cache memory system in Verilog. The cache is designed to improve the performance of data access by storing frequently accessed data closer to the processor. The implementation includes a cache memory module, a cache controller, and a testbench for verification.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **src/**: Contains the source files for the cache implementation.
  - `cache.v`: Implementation of the cache memory module.
  - `cache_controller.v`: Logic for managing cache operations.
  - `defines.vh`: Parameter definitions and constants.

- **testbench/**: Contains the testbench for the cache module.
  - `cache_tb.v`: Testbench that verifies the functionality of the cache.

- **docs/**: Contains documentation for the project.
  - `README.md`: Documentation overview and usage instructions.

- `README.md`: General project overview and setup instructions.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory to view the source files.
3. Use a Verilog simulator to compile and run the testbench located in the `testbench` directory.
4. Refer to the `docs/README.md` for detailed information on the cache implementation and design considerations.

## Design Considerations
- The cache size and block size are defined in `defines.vh` and can be adjusted based on the requirements.
- The cache controller handles cache hits and misses, ensuring efficient data transfer between the cache and main memory.
- The testbench provides a comprehensive set of test vectors to validate the functionality of the cache module.

## Conclusion
This Verilog cache implementation serves as a foundational project for understanding cache memory systems. It can be extended and modified for various applications and performance optimizations.
